### What is typescript?
Typescript is a superset of javascript. It allows to write javascript in a much precise manner. Typescript is all about TypeSafety.

Example code :
 2 + "2" = '22'

### What typescript does:
**static checking :** Analyze the code as we type. <br/>
<br>
Code format : **.ts, .tsx** extensions. <br/>
Typescript code converted into javascript. <br/>
Typescript is a development tool.

Typescript free playground : [typescript playground.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) <br/>
Example code :
`var user = {name:"sarvesh", age:22};
var email = user.email;`

### Typescript installation :
Before installing typescript, you have to install these things, if you have already installed these thinks that's good.
- node
- npm <br/>
And checkout there versions, because if any thing wrong in the installation, it will throw errors. And it will help out to find the problem and fix it. `-v` this flag will help to find out the version of your package. 

Example : `node -v`

If all looks good you will see like this. <br/>

For global installation : <br/>
`npm install -g typescript` <br/>

To checkout typescript version simply use this command `tsc -v` in your terminal. <br/>

I have created a separate branch for code examples, you can find out the codes in that branch.
